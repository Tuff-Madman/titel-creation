## AMBIGUITY AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION

It may occur that information between the Produkt factsheet attribute data and visual image information is contradictory, confusing, or ambiguous. Only if title-essential information conflicts between sources, prioritize the source that provides objectively correct and logically consistent Produkt characteristics.

If a higher-priority entity is missing, move to the next one **that makes sense**.  

Visual evidence from the attached product images should:
- Take precedence for form, shape, and design elements when absolute certainty exists about visual characteristics
- Be used for supplementary corrective interpretation when high confidence can be established
- Apply only according to the specific scenarios listed below:


### SCENARIOS

1. Image with round Table vs. rectangular Attribute Data: IF visual shows round table BUT factsheet provides only Höhe [H] cm, Breite [B] cm (no Durchmesser):
→ Transform using max(H, B) as Durchmesser (e.g. ".... 80 cm Durchmesser ...")
